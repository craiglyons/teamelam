I feel like I should write a book: What your girlfriends didn&#8217;t tell you aka sending your baby to kindergarten! This has been one of the hardest hurdles since we started this journey 6 years ago! Granted we&#8217;re in a new place, I&#8217;m super pregnant, and my girls are just as tied to their big brother as I am! But come on!!! My bestie Leah, shrugged off sending her little sprite to kindergarten last year as a fun and liberating experience, I was set for something like that. Instead, I put Noah on the bus with an uncontrollable sadness and trepidation that turned to panic after I lost sight of him. The boohoo breakfast &#8211; put on by the elementary school to help other first timers such as myself break the bond &#8211; was no help as most of the attendees either work for the school or were praying on poor unsepcting parents recruiting for the PTA!Jennifer is amused, but secretly I think a little horrified, at my inability to sever this tie&#8230; So send me good thoughts over these next couple of weeks! I&#8217;m going to need them!
