Â i.e. there&#8217;s music you like, you go to a venue, hear them and blessedly share that excitement with thousands of others channeling the exact same sentiment!

We had no theatrics getting there. Â We left our delightful children in completely capable hands and set off for Milwaukee slipping into the theatre just as they were letting the throng through the doors. Â So fantastic!! as that brought us great seats and access to the pit! We danced, we sang, we shared sweets with our neighbors ðŸ˜‰ Â I tried talking Jennifer into following them to chi-town for their next concert but he dutifully reminded me of the 2 little bumpkins waiting for us at home, so we came back&#8230;this time.
