Yep. We are down for the count. All that cruisin, all that kool-aid I mentioned, came home with us in the form of a big yucky sickness that has pretty much knocked us all on our ass. I joke with Jennifer as I feel like life always has a balance- a good to combat the bad. Well, you know we had ourselves ALOT of good in the Caribbean cause now we&#8217;re just trying to survive through this bad. So on this New Year&#8217;s Eve, when we looked back on our thankful moments of 2013 and shared our hopes for 2014, we do it with the hope that we leave this yuck behind and begin the year anew ðŸ™‚ Happy 2014!!! </p>
