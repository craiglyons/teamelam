[That being said, i was a little nostalgic watching all our babies&#8230;  It is truly magical having kids as everything else just stops while you acclimate and change!  Your struggle and growth, elation and exhaustion all feed into this awesome life changing thing.  I am so thankful we&#8217;ve recorded these moments and discoveries as I can scroll through and watch our little ones grow into people.  I&#8217;m awed as these woman have helped shape my little ones, but most especially me, to be better!!  Now as I look at Ima trying to navigate through her frustrations &#8211; walking, climbing, talking &#8211;  and listen as Noah strategizes his argument for &#8220;5 more minutes before bed&#8221;  I&#8217;m blown away at how far we&#8217;ve come!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157623886078648/)
