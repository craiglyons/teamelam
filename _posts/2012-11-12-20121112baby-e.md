I feel so excited/anxious/CRAZY for our new arrival. We know from &#8220;the reveal&#8221; that it&#8217;s a little girl &#8211; although Noah is still holding out till the end praying for a boy ðŸ™‚ This baby is the most active of the bunch. My tummy is a constant show of movement as she somersaults and kicks. The kiddos are excited too as they watch the show and talk to our little baby E. They help me pick out her cloths and toys ðŸ™‚ so cute to have so many champions. I know she will add to us in ways I cannot fathom! I AM READY! Bring it on!
