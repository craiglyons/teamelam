Jennifer and I took a business night and headed to Memorial Union to see Sir Ken Robinson speak about education in our nation. &nbsp;It was enlightening and commiserating at the same time as our educational system &#8211; to which we will devote 4 nebile young minds &#8211; seems like such an abysmal mess! &nbsp;We have always been advocates for the diversity of the public school system, but with so many cut-backs and standardization, I&#8217;m leaning toward a more privatized system&#8230; Ken finished his speech talking about a parent&#8217;s ability to identify your own childs needs and then investing the time and effort to help them get to a good place with it. &nbsp;His example detailed a child of about 6 who excelled at walking on his hands. &nbsp;He could go up and down steps, walk the hall, explore all upside-down making a joke about how when things got slow at dinner parties his parents would ask him to &#8220;perform&#8221; to help start up interest in the conversation. &nbsp;His mom, noticing that this wasn&#8217;t simply a phase, took him to a gym where he we able to use his talent, expand upon it, and eventually became one of the most decorated Olympians in the world.

I can only watch Noah and Ima now and try to give them the confidence to try all their hearts desire so that they may find their talent and happiness&#8230;
