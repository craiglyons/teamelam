Tonight was a real teaching moment as we started walking Noah through the basic steps on how to read. &nbsp;He bit his tongue as he concentrated on sounding out each letter. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll never forget how after every new word, he had this look of complete reverence, as if he would never again make the mistake of not recognizing that word! &nbsp;Ima was soon jumping in, wanting to learn with Harley looking on as we sounded out letter by letter &#8211; together. &nbsp;How fun to be able to bridge this understanding to have the kids piggy back this excitement. loving it ðŸ™‚ &nbsp;</p>
