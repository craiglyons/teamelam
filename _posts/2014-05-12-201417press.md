I used a garlic press for the first time today. I unearthed it after cleaning out a seldomly used drawer and had to look it up &#8211; I was at such a loss with what it was.   
It was changed by life BTW! While I normally enjoy smashing the little knobs into oblivion, I made allowances today and shelled my little bulbs and shoved them in the slot to squeeze my hearts content.   
Who knew that 2 weeks of vacation with 3 days of snow could really be cured with a little bit of mutilation by a kitchen appliance.   
Cheers :):)
