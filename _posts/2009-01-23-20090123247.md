Jennifer and I try to come together every day and share a high and low moment. Â It&#8217;s one of my favorite things we do as we can connect about something that happened to each of usÂ separately,Â thatÂ we then share withÂ each other. Â  Our high / low moments can range from midnightÂ margaritasÂ to naked time with kids goneÂ terriblyÂ terriblyÂ wrong ğŸ™‚ This past Tuesday evictedÂ so many emotions from us that breaking it down into 1 high, 1 memorable moment, proved nearly impossible.
  
In our younger,Â lessÂ encumberedÂ days (noÂ offense Noah &#8211; Imagen ğŸ™‚ we would have made the trip without a backward glance! but our ability to pick up and take off has become a much larger production. Â TheÂ regretÂ we felt not being present for the inauguration was overshadowed by our sense of conviction that the changes taking place in the country are truly awe inspiring! Â It was an amazing day; one I feel will always choke me up looking back on it.

My high for the day was the image of Barrack and Michele getting out of their limo and deciding, instead of watching the crowd from the car, to walk with the parade down the street. Â TheyÂ emanatedÂ a selflessness and embodied an understanding in that moment that really spoke to me.

Jennifer&#8217;s high was knowing that when Noah and Imagen grow up and vote, racial differences will be a thing of the past. Being able to say,&#8221;the color of someone&#8217;s skin makes no difference what they can achieve&#8230;&#8221; and the knowledge that he and I had a hand in making that statement come true! is in itself empowering.

I hope each of you had a moment where you stopped andÂ acknowledgedÂ that &#8220;change-is-a-coming!!&#8221; and we can make a difference!
