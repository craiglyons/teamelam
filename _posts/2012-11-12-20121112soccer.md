Jennifer helped coach Noah&#8217;s soccer team this year and it really took on a life of its own. We just concluded the season and they threw a party to celebrate the kiddos and the coaches. Parents cried talking about how much their kids had improved and really excelled on this team. It was the first of many moments for us to be a part of something like this. So so proud of my hubby and of course my little gamechanger!!!! GO LIGHTENING TIGERS!
