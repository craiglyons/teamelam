Noah and i had an appointment today with a Pediatric Gastroenterologist.  His name was [Dr. Michael Yaffe](http://www.deancare.com/dhs/provider/doc_info.asp?id=506 "Dr. Michael Yaffe").  He looked Noah over, weighed him (noah&#8217;s put on 11 oz.) and declared that he is a healthy, happy, and highly active little boy!  he also remarked that he is one of the cutest babies he&#8217;s seen in quite some time!  and that our fear of an allergy to gluten is completely unconfounded!! it&#8217;s been a grrrrrrrrrreat day!!
