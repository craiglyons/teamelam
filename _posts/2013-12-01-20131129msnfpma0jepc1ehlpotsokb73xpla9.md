Our dinner convo tonight revolved around the meaning of Thanksgiving. I start with &#8220;The meaning of Thanksgiving is all about&#8230; when Noah interrupts me and finishes &#8220;leftovers!&#8221; Almost laughed out loud, but recovered quickly and said some of our most Thankful things &#8211; family, friends, food and a roof to hold us all.   
Hope this gave you alittle giggle and your holiday was filled with Thanks and leftovers ðŸ™‚
