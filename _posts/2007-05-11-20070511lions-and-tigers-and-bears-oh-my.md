I’m so sorry guys! I’ve started to really get into our days up here and it&#8217;s been so hard to find the time to detail it all on the blog! Things are going great! We just got back from the [zoo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157600202588887/ "zoo")! We walked around all day with buffalo and lions, rode the carousel in the children’s section and, even though Noah slept through it, went through the monkey and reptile houses!

We&#8217;ve been to 3 other b-day party&#8217;s with another teddy-bear party coming up next week! And [swimming](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157600049893183/ "swimming") is finally starting to be a &#8211; good fun thing &#8211; instead of &#8211; that cold, wet, loud thing we make him do! He’s been successfully dunked! And while I think he&#8217;s still trying to figure out why we would want to submerge him, he&#8217;s trying to be a good sport about it! I&#8217;m posting all of our pics from the past couple of weeks so PLEASE feel free to check [them](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/ "them") out!

Our biggest focus right now is trying to get noah to put on the pounds! He&#8217;s pretty low on the overall scale so we&#8217;re eating, eating, eating! all the time!
