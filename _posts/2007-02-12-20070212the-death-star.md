We have just begun to delve into the adventurous world of exersaucers and come out on the other end with &#8220;The Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper&#8221; that Jennifer lovingly termed &#8221; the death star.&#8221; Noah is LOVING it! He bounces. he slaps, he turns(with a little assistance) At first I was skeptical that we needed ALL OF THIS for him to enjoy but for the good 10 minutes he&#8217;s in it unassisted, makes it all worth it!
