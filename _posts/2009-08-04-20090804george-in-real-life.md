we went to see curious george at the bookstore today. noah mistook him for a stuffed animal and walked right up for a little rub. when george shifted &#8211; mistaking Noah&#8217;s move for a hug, noah (and his daddy:) both let out a little scream that spread like the plague through our small story group&#8230; we definitely didn&#8217;t make any friends this trip&#8230;

here&#8217;s ima going in for a &#8220;close but not too close&#8221; cuddle ðŸ™‚
