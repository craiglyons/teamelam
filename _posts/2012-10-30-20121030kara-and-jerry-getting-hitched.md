This was such an amazing wedding!  The kids had their own playground complete with putt putt golf and a carousel (huge hit!) but because the small detail of the kiddos was so completely taken care of and we had all hands on deck with nana and popie on patrol &#8211; Jennifer and I soaked in our first wedding since our own. We danced, we laughed, we toasted the bride and groom in the cigar tent and topped off the evening dancing under the cheerio lights.  It was truly a magical weekend.
