Noah got into trouble tonight and was sent to bed without a story. I was nursing Ever when he popped his head out to tell me that he remembered all of the bad things he did today. He fell asleep before I could get back up to talk to him. So so hard not to want to snuggle him and tell him how much I love him. I wanted him to take a minute and reflect on his choices tonight. And I&#8217;m proud of myself as a mother for resisting the urge to go to him and forgive before he had that minute to process but man was it hard! One of those moments when its easier to be a friend than to be a parent. I can only hope that when our turn comes, when our kids have kids and we get to visit and spoil while they teach the hard lessons, this moment will be one of many instilled in him to make him the strong and incredible man he will grow up to be. One day :):)
