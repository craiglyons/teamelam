I forwarded these tips to my fam but wanted to post them as well. Jennifer and i couldn&#8217;t believe some of these!

THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW YOUR CELL PHONE COULD DO.

There are a few things that can be done in times of grave

emergencies. Your mobile phone can actually be a life saver or an

emergency tool for survival. Check out the things that you can do

with it:

FIRST

Subject: Emergency

The Emergency Number worldwide for Mobile is 112. If you find yourself

out of the coverage area of your mobile; network and there is an

emergency, dial 112 and the mobile will search any existing network to

establish the emergency number for you, and interestingly this number

112 can be dialed even if the keypad is locked. Try it out.

SECOND

Subject: Have you locked your keys in the car?

Does your car have remote keyless entry? This may come in handy

someday. Good reason to own a cell phone: If you lock your keys in the

car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their cell

phone from your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot from your

car door and have the person at your home press the unlock button,

holding it near the mobile phone on their end. Your car will unlock.

Saves someone from having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no

object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach

someone who has the other &#8220;remote&#8221; for your car, you can unlock the

doors (or the trunk).

THIRD

Subject: Hidden Battery Power

Imagine your cell battery is very low. To activate, press the keys

*3370# Your cell will restart with this reserve and the instrument will

show a 50% increase in battery. This reserve will get charged when you

charge your cell next time.

FOURTH

Subject: How to disable a STOLEN mobile phone?

To check your Mobile phone&#8217;s serial number, key in the following digits

on your phone: * # 0 6 #

A 15 digit code will appear on the screen. This number is unique to

your handset. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. When your phone

get stolen, you can phone your service provider and give them this code.

They will then be able to block your handset so even if the thief

changes the SIM card, your phone will be totally useless. You probably

won&#8217;t get your phone back, but at least you know that whoever stole it

ca n&#8217;t use/sell it either. If everybody does this, there would be no

point in people stealing mobile phones.

And Finally&#8230;.FIFTH

Cell phone companies are charging us $1.00 to $1.75 or more for 411

information calls when they don&#8217;t have to. Most of us do not carry a

telephone directory in our vehicle, which makes this situation even

more of a problem. When you need to use the 411 information option,

simply dial: (800) FREE 411, or (800) 373-3411 without incurring any

charge at all. Program this into your cell phone now.

HAPPY TALKING!
