[There were so many moments from this trip!  Thank you jas and em for sharing yourselves with us &#8211; i&#8217;ll send you money for the blinds;) Thank you to my uncle and aunt for hosting and opening your lives to the chaos of our entire elam-davenport -and hopefully next time-anderson clan!  you have a truly beautiful and tranquil home that is a perfect backdrop for the trash-talking, baby crying, celebration that is our davenport games. Thank you Mary Katharine! as you not only reminded me of my CPR training, but captured such memories with your camera and talent!  You have done such an amazing job of embracing and sharing our spirit!  Check out our other moments!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157624202347673/)
