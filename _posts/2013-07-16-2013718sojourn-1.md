We have arrived!

Last night was the first time to see the ocean for the littles. Ever looked, listened and promptly fell asleep ðŸ™‚ Harley watched the water, her little body tensed as wave after wave rolled in. I watched her from a distance with my own sense of awe as our last ocean visit I was still pregnant with her.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve come so far since then. On that day it was Ima I held in my arms as we followed a 4 year old Noah fearlessly charging into the waves. 

I&#8217;m going to enjoy this. I&#8217;m going to accept this blessing and trust that there are things at work on this earth much larger than myself, enjoy the happiness that only life at the beach can bring, enjoy that I don&#8217;t need to turn on &#8220;ocean waves&#8221; for the kids to sleep tonight- its here, the waves and lap of the water a constant lullaby.
