It was &#8220;supposedly&#8221; the hottest day of the year today in madison (my verdict&#8217;s out till we get through july ðŸ™‚ and never before had the implication hit me so hard that I have become complacently spoiled by the midwest&#8217;s weather. Â sure we suffer through a winter i can&#8217;t even do justice with words, when it snows in may and you&#8217;re so sick of the cold, but then the summer hits and you know why you braved the ice and snow, it&#8217;s these few idealistic months that are such a slice of perfection, with a light breeze and temps in the 70&#8217;s&#8230; today was not that day ðŸ™‚ Â We hit our multisport class this am for a little inside play-time and even in the confines of the [keva](http://www.kevasports.com/ "keva") dome, noah was flushed and sweaty! so we packed up and headed to the [splash park](http://www.channel3000.com/news/16792781/detail.html "splash park") for a wet lunch with friends. Â there is nothing so fun and innocent as kids trampling through flying water. Â and what a day for it ðŸ™‚
