Miguel, our latina 93 jeep cherokee is no more (and I really mean that, i think they&#8217;re going to use him for parts)

Jennifer and I are now the proud owners of a [mazda cx-9](http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayPage.action?pageParameter=modelsMain&vehicleCode=CX9 "mazda cx-9")!! we are currently debating the personality of the cx in order to properly name him (as his sex has been established)

This gi-normous &#8220;cock pit wannabe&#8221; is Noah&#8217;s new [car seat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/ "car seat").
