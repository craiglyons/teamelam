I never had a predisposition about what motherhood would be like. I really had never given it any thought. i assumed that if Jennifer and i were ready, we would begin planning for a baby, and then would have a bouncy little boy/girl something like a year later. But I never thought about what it would feel like to be a mother. To actually be responsible for a little person. I mean there were no people and then there were people, it&#8217;s pretty crazy.

To be perfectly honest,up to this point, I feel that I&#8217;ve been pretty much self involved (and rightly so) as that self involvement helped to define me as me, but now that i have Noah, now that I&#8217;m teaching him, and loving him, helping him to get to that next little milestone, I&#8217;ve never done anything that has felt so important. I truly feel blessed to have been given this gift, this awareness that I think can only come with being a mother. He is our greatest accomplishment.
