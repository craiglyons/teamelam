I&#8217;m sitting here on the first truly chilly morning we&#8217;ve had in VA.&nbsp;Harley has her head in my lap.&nbsp;Noah and Ima are singing downstairs.<span>&nbsp; Ever&#8217;s snuggled in close with her daddy. &nbsp;</span>

<span>We knew that having 4 kiddos so close together would be intense and I&#8217;m ok with that &#8211;&nbsp;we&#8217;ve always been intense ðŸ™‚ But&nbsp;the rollar coaster of all&nbsp;4 kiddos hitting&nbsp;a 6 year learning curve,&nbsp;with the greatest of greats &#8211; for we will go through each stage&nbsp;</span><span>1 x 4 &#8211; really hit me today.&nbsp; My biggest</span><span>&nbsp;fear is&nbsp;</span><span>not that they will go without, but that each day there are soo many moments that I miss, that I&#8217;ll forget, that will fly by.&nbsp;</span>

So today,&nbsp;Ima giving Harley a little boost to get on Noah&#8217;s bed for stories,&nbsp;Ever&#8217;s giggles as&nbsp;her big brother&nbsp;dances and pops all around her &#8211; are the moments I want&nbsp;to preserve. &nbsp;These&nbsp;moments I&#8217;ve captured.
