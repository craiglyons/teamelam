They shot a rocket into space today!!!! and get this! if you timed it just right, you could actually see it from our house (IE the east coast ðŸ™‚ Picture it: 1960, hundreds of people crowding together watching this massive machine climb into the sky! Exploring a whole new world! I wanted that. I wanted our kids to see this incredible feat! I wanted to see the awe as they watched this rocketship go into space!

It didn&#8217;t happen. We didn&#8217;t get to spot the streak and couldn&#8217;t be sure of the sound but I still rallied the troops to look out at the sky and talked to them about a world completely outside of ours&#8230;. Pretty cool ðŸ™‚&nbsp;
