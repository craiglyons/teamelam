[The new memorial is truly awe-inspiring.   Hugging the tidal basin there are small waterfalls tucked into an arched rock inscribed with MLK&#8217;s most notable quotes.  The centered sculpture -said to represent the stone of hope out of the mountain of despair &#8211; is magnanimous. Just an incredible sight!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157628916820025/)
