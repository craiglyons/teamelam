What a weekend! It was a wonderful, snuggled in, movie watching, rainy day weekend; where we cacooned ourselves together and just enjoyed. Jennifer and I put the kids to bed last night and then rearranged the whole house! Moving furniture and bringing up what is usually down! Â The kids went nuts when they woke up! It just tickled me to watch them run from room to room screaming and laughing about the changes. Ahhh the power and contentment enjoying the little things ðŸ™‚
