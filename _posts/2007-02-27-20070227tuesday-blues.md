Have you ever had one of those days that no matter what you did, how many times you started over, put that smile back up, and trudged through, it just kept getting worse&#8230; and then worse still&#8230; well that was my day.
  
I won&#8217;t bore you with the details but if you were hoping to catch me today, forget it. Save the convo and call tomorrow because today, I&#8217;m getting back in my pj&#8217;s and am going to try and forget the mishap that is tuesday.
