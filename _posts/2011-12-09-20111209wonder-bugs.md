[To describe our family as nature enthusiasts is a bit of an understatement. We &#8211; and I admit this has been a late-in-life development personally, LOVE to get involved with animals. We are squirrel hunters, hawk watchers, beaver supporters and fox enthusiasts.  So when our local Nature Center offered a new class for kiddos to get more involved, I did not hesitate to sign up.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157627696487211/)

[The theme of this class was &#8220;tails&#8221; in which case our incredibly excitable nature teacher preemptively stowed puppets along the trail, socking away the animals indigenous to our region.  Ms. Laura, our 20 something nature enthusiast decked out in boy scout uniform and mount me hat &#8211; explains the game of the day:  to **stealthy** find the animals hiding along the trail.  She then yells &#8220;GO!!&#8221;](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157627696487211/)

[Noah and Ima streak off. Noah finds a possum. He tosses it over a little boys&#8217; head to Ima who instantly spikes the stuffed animal in what I can only assume is her best Ima/daddy football moment replayed on the nature trail. The other moms instantly look to me with displeasure.
