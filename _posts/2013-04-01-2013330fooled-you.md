I can&#8217;t believe a year ago today Jennifer and I found out we were pregnant w/ our little Ever. I will never forget telling my parents &#8211; ecstatic to tears &#8211; and my BFF Leah &#8211; who replied &#8220;I&#8217;m preggers too!&#8221; The difference being her bby &#8211; an April fools day ploy &#8211; was done that day. For us, 9 months later, Ever rounded out our family to a nice even 6. Blessed, thankful, and keeping the faith that this path is the one we were meant to walk. Happy April Fools!!!
