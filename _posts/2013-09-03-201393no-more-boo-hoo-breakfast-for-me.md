What a difference a year has made &#8211; for both of us LOL.&nbsp; This first day of school Noah met head on! Dressed &#8211; studiously picking out a contrast in colors:) Fed &#8211; breakfast of champions omelet and pop-tarts &#8211; and packed up &#8211; with baby Orca (pictured below) before my feet ever hit the floor!&nbsp; Feeling lucky to have a little boy so excited to start school ðŸ™‚

Here&#8217;s to a great day for him and a fun day with just the girls ðŸ˜‰
