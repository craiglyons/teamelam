We have a song!  It&#8217;s not romantic and it won&#8217;t remind me of our beginings but everytime I hear it, the kids go crazy!  We dance around, jumping and clapping, smiling and laughing all together.  I want to take that moment and bottle it.  It is the most precious memory for our family!

I GOTTA FEELING!!!
