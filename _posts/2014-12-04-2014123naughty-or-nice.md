Sooooo, one of the crazy things they do here in Fairfax is a Santa run. Santa himself, rides a fire truck down the street waving with Mrs. Clause and a Dalmatian at their feet.   

We, of course, run outside waving and shouting our love! This year as I tucked the kids into bed, Harley asks if she can do her wish list with nana (totally predictable) but as I go in to tuck Noah he looks worried. I ask him what&#8217;s wrong and he replys &#8220;I hope I&#8217;m not on the naughty list&#8221;   

Ohhhhhh my! It was everything I could do to keep a straight face ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
