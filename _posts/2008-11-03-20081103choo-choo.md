We took advantage of the warm-ish weather and drove up to this little train station in the Dells so that Noah (who is in LOVE with choo choo trains) could ride in an actual locomotor. <img id="image238" alt="train.jpg" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50db6bb3e4b015296cd43789/50dfa5b1e4b0dc6320e0b5ea/50dfa5b1e4b0dc6320e0b6ca/1224421962000/?format=original" />suffice it to say, Noah was a little shell shocked by the actual choo choo of the train, it was loud with real steam and blasting whistles and it just about scared the crap out of him.
