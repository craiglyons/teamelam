[I can&#8217;t believe our little game changer is 6. He is such an amazing spirit. He is inventive, loving and protective of his sisters, but most especially he&#8217;s a sponge! He pours over books and documentaries soaking up as much information as possible on wildlife, ocean ecosystems, and big cats ðŸ™‚ He is such an exact replica of his daddy. Strong willed, stubborn to a fault, and bound to change the world! Happy Birthday little man!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157631891685351/)
