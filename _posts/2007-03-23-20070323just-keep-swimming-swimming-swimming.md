Noah had his first swim lesson last night!!  It was really cool to see an entire facility completely devoted to children’s swim.  I think kids need a special environment to feel safe and comfortable in order to begin to trust being in the water, and [Swimwest](http://www.swimwest.com/aquababies.htm "Swimwest") is just that place!  I&#8217;m slacking on the pictures, the whole lesson took both Jennifer and i doing the dance to keep Noah happy so i didn&#8217;t get the chance to snap any pics but I promise I’ll capture Noah doing the crawl next week!
