It was such an amazing moment for me as I could see everything register to him; the music (fyi &#8211; Mendelssohn: Hebrides, Glazunov: “From the Middle Ages” Symphonic Suite, and Stravinsky: Berceuse and Finale from Firebird 1919) my cello, Blake our conductor,  all swam across his face!!  I also saw my husband, looking back at me with such pride and strength &#8211; it was staggering the love I felt from him.

Jennifer, you are my partner in crime, my best friend, my lobster. I would never be the person I am without you.  You who picked up the slack so I could practice, who nudged me on when I was too tired to go, who shouted from the rafters that I made the MCO, and who never missed a beat.  You are my quan!
