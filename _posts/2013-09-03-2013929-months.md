Ever Grey at 9 months. &nbsp;Her blanky is still the end-all-be-all &#8211; this is her playing peek-a-boo upon waking from naps. &nbsp;She is soo happy, sooo mellow, I almost worry :):) &nbsp;She has 4 new teeth &#8211; 2 top 2 bottom and while hesitant to take those first steps, she is continuously absorbing her surroundings and constantly stealing the show. &nbsp;
