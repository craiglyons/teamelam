If you stare at it long enough  
The mountain becomes unclimbable.&nbsp;  
Tally it up. &nbsp;How much time have you spent&nbsp;  
Waiting for the soup to cool?  
Icicles hang from January gutters  
Only as long as they can. Fingers pause above piano keys for the chord &#8211;  
That will not form. Slam them down / I say. Make music of what you can.&nbsp;

Charles Rafferty, from &#8220;Against Hesitation&#8221;</p>
