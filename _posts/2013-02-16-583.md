There was a freedom heading home that I didn&#8217;t know I needed until we crossed the state-line into Tennessee. &nbsp;The trip solidified that all too&nbsp;familiar pull of home&nbsp;as we drove &#8211; slowly watching the dwindling snow and ice fade into mountains and rock. &nbsp;The&nbsp;cross country trek to&nbsp;Jay and Debbie&#8217;s is always surreal as their home not only holds so many memories for Jennifer and I but reveals whole new world to the kids. &nbsp;The farm is timeless boasting cows, horses, goats and land as far as the eye can see. &nbsp;Noah went for a tractor ride with his grandpa Jay, rode a four-wheeler with his great uncle Jeffery and swam in a mountain of corn. (all on video;) &nbsp;I want so much for both him and Ima most importantly, I want them to feel the freedom of running until you can&#8217;t stop. Of exploring the wilderness until you discover something new. Of knowing that there are a million ways to live and that they can pick whichever one they want.</p>
