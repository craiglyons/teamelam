I always wonder what moments we&#8217;ll look on back to preserve&#8230; Â ðŸ™‚
  
there&#8217;s a second everyday when Jennifer walks through the door andÂ everyone sighs that eternal, &#8220;daddy&#8217;s home!&#8221; sentiment. He immediately gets bombarded and eventually ends up, under a pile of people, on the couch ðŸ™‚ my spot&#8217;s right there in the middle. i miss him too.
