A little known fact about Jennifer and I (although maybe not so little known anymore as we are forever chamioning our quest for the best chocolaty decadence LOL) is our love of chocolate donuts. Donuts are woven into our tapestry, our beginning, our first kiss, our all night study sessions, our wedding, and now our stolen moments, all point back to the humble donut ðŸ™‚ So tonight, when my mom took the kids home for us and we shared a few stolen moments, we walked next door to the donut place and grabbed our sweet treat. It&#8217;s all about the little things :):)
