ok team, I have just mastered (well maybe mastered is a strong word for&nbsp;inter-web&nbsp;use ðŸ˜‰ but have&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;begun my understanding&nbsp;on how to upload my videos to our flickr site. Now as many of you know my completely and totally fabulous&nbsp;husband&nbsp;got me a flip video camera for christmas and I&#8217;ve been the loan producer in our family show for quite some time. so without further ado, check out our flickr page for some unedited footage of the Elam&#8217;s in motion!
