thats right folks, noah is 6 months today! We celebrated with a fancy play group where we played, talked, and took a tour of our new car! It was quite the exciting time. I didnt get a chance to take any pics so I&#8217;ll have to share next time!

It was dreary here in Wisconsin today, I hope you are all reading this with sunny skies and happy hearts on this first day of spring!
