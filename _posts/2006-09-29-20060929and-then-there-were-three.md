I am proud to present **Noah Emmett Elam**. Just click on the linked file below and a quicktime movie will play photos of his first week. Enjoy!

ps: If you can&#8217;t get the video to load try downloading the [Quicktime plug-in for Windows.](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/win.html) Its the link on the left of the page after the jump. Good luck! Let us know if this doesn&#8217;t work.
