Jennifer and I recently experienced one of those wonderful and majestic events that make up parenthood&#8230; DATE NIGHT!We went to dinner and a movie, unwittingly charmed by &#8220;Dan in real life&#8221; about a widowed father (steve carell) raising 3 girls and spending x-mas with his family. I know, sounds like a hall-of-famer! but it reminded me of &#8220;the davenport games&#8221; of the honesty and reliability of family, of how great it is to have all of you in our lives! but really, it reminded me of my childhood, of my own &#8220;MURDERER OF LOVE&#8221; dramas with my parents.

It made me laugh, it made me cry, and because Jennifer and I are only at the cusp of understanding what its like to be a family, we laughed like crazy!

Go see it, I KNOW you&#8217;ll love it!
