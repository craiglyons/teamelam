Our dream has always been mobile; live anywhere, work anywhere, be anywhere &#8211; together. And while our family has grown &#8211; really grown! &#8211; we held on to that ideal to see the world and enjoy the discovery of what&#8217;s out there.  So, while our incorporation has changed (3 kiddos will flex any plan:-) WE DID IT! What I can only hope to be the beginning of many new adventures!  Team ELAM is now part of the National Capital Region! So stay tuned, it&#8217;s gonna be a wild ride!
