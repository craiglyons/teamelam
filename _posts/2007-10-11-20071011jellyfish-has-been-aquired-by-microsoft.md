No I didn&#8217;t make that title up. <a title="Jellyfish" target="_blank" href="http://www.jellyfish.com">Jellyfish</a>, the internet company I helped start nearly 2 years ago, has been bought by Microsoft. Its been an incredible journey. I feel honored to have worked with such an amazing team, many of which have become honorary Elamites!

Straight from the <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2007/10/01/microsoft-acquires-jellyfish-com.aspx">mothership</a>:

> Jellyfish has done some really innovative work in comparative shopping engines. We think the technology has some interesting potential applications as we continue to invest heavily in shopping and commerce as a key component of Live Search. Stay tuned for more great stuff from our new colleagues in Madison!

Where we go from here is anyone&#8217;s guess. Jen and I just want to be a happy little family, but other than that we&#8217;re just thrilled to part of such an incredible event.

I believe my fellow collegue said it best in his blog post, &#8220;I think my favorite part so far is that I no longer have to respond with &#8220;just fine thanks, and how are things going where you work?&#8221; when asked about my job.&#8221;

Well said Nick, well said.
