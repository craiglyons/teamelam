I am astounded at how lucky I am to experience life with someone I cherish. We&#8217;ve been through so much. I can only thank god he is the man he is. Our paths have gone in many directions, taken so many turns &#8211; not one of them anticipated LOL &#8211; but he is my lobster, my match, and together we have prevailed. I am thankful for his strength, his humor, his drive. And am reminded that this too shall pass&#8230;
