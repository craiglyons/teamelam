We&#8217;re gearing up for Halloween &#8211; it&#8217;s one of our favorites &#8211; but let&#8217;s face it, Team Elam LOVEs to celebrate! so every holiday is its&#8217; own special party &#8211; The kids are super psyched this year &#8211; they fondly remember the candy coma of 2010. Noah already has his Orca costume (thank you Grandma Debbie) and we are on the hunt for a pinky pie pony for Ima.

What can I say, kids keep you young!!
