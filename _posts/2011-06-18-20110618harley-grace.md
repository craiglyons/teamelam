[We welcomed our 3rd and final ðŸ˜‰ member to our family 6/1/11. Â Harley weighed in at 8.5lbs 21 inches and has been a dream! She has a feisty spirit with an insatiable appetite. She loves to snuggle, only sleeps sitting up (a mild hurdle for us to navigate) and doesn&#8217;t even flinch at the chaos and noise levels Team Elam doles out! Â Noah fell in love at first site saying he wished we would have 20 more babies just like her whereas Ima&#8217;s quietly holding out for the dust to settle. Jennifer and I both feel so incredibly complete. Â Love to ALL our friends and family!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157627077782870/)
