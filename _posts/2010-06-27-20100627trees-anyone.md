[I&#8217;m so excited we&#8217;ve come into some breathing room to latch back onto this central theme and with a few minor tweaks to add some Ima element, we&#8217;ve finally started painting our new version nursery!   I can&#8217;t wait to share with you!!  Here&#8217;s Noah&#8217;s old room to hold you till we get this new one done!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/425526927/sizes/l/)
