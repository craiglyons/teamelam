Jennifer and i have recently entered into the wild and wacky realm of the car buying business. It is a intricate dance as you walk into the dealership: you want to buy a car, but you don&#8217;t want to be too eager to buy a car, then you decide on the car and you look longingly at it as the salesman walks away but as he turns you plaster the &#8220;I don&#8217;t really want this car look&#8221; and act as if you could take it off of his hands if he would like to unload it&#8221; not to mention the fact that everything these days has some kind of cryptic reference like LR3, CX9, RX,

It&#8217;s a tricky tricky business&#8230; I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
