he has spoken!! Noah said his first word today! dada has been uttered and mumbled 10 times since and if you listen long enough to the babble, youâ€™ll at least hear dada along with a myriad of other small syllables such as ahhhh, maaaaa, baaaaa, you get the point! I hope everyone is having a fantastic weekend!

HAPPY EASTER!
