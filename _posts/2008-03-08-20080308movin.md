WE HAVE OFFICIALLY MOVED! We spent our first saturday here surrounded by boxes, clutter, and craziness, watching a fox chase the dozens of birds flitting around our backyard and it was so blissfully wonderful, I don&#8217;t remember a time i&#8217;ve been more happy! Never mind that we can&#8217;t find clean undies or matching socks. We are a family and we&#8217;ve just found our home.
