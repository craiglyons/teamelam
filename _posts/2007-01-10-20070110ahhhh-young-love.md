Noah and I have started a [music class](http://www.musictogether.com "music class").  Its basic premise is to entertain and encourage interaction for babies with different songs, beats, and instruments.  I loved it!
  
i danced, i sang, i played the tambourine, the bells, I shook the eggbeaters and beat on the floor.  Noah however,  found Audrey.  We shared a blanket and from the moment i put him down, he was staring at, playing with, flirting! (I know he&#8217;s 4 months but you should have seen him, smiling and giggling at her) the whole class. So my dancing, circling and noise making went unnoticed!

I didn&#8217;t get a chance to capture this unrequited love affair, i&#8217;ll post a pic next week!
