My little man is completely enthralled with animals. &nbsp;We constantly read, watch and explore all matter of animals and their habitats. &nbsp;The reenactment of the dinosaur age is a huge favorite as Big Al (the alsauraus) makes his way looking for prey and for danger DUN DUN DOOONNN!!!! &nbsp;But his all time favorite, the one he&#8217;ll drop everything for.. Orca whales! &nbsp;Our trip to sea world last July was one of the most memorable tips of his life as we were able to catch sham-u in the flesh ðŸ˜‰ so when Jennifer and I caught wind of this new disney movie &#8220;oceans&#8221; coming out, we wanted to surprise noah. &nbsp;The movie theatre popcorn-soda-candy surround sound excitement ALL on the big screen!
