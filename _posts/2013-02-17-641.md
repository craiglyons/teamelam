I love our house. &nbsp;It is small by many standards, challenging me to come up with a better way-better system to organize and distribute all of the stuff needed to sustain a growing family of 4. But just as I am sorting and stacking, I am growing. &nbsp;As our marsh is coming to life and our trees and plants are all budding new leaves and growth, I am learning more about me- more about what makes me happy and feel content. &nbsp;More of what I want to pass onto our children and the life lessens important enough to live. &nbsp;For instance, &nbsp;I like small. &nbsp;I like using what we have and I think if you&#8217;re organized enough, each thing has its place. &nbsp;I like when functionality meets design where it perfectly blends at ease of use. &nbsp;I like finding new ways to find each item its apace. &nbsp;I like to use what we have and to rejoice in our ability to reduce our waste and our footprint. &nbsp;Even now as I write this I&#8217;m watching a family of bunnies test out our new rain-garden. &nbsp;I love looking out any window and watching life happen. &nbsp;in the hopes that even that small step will do something to help sustain our backyard preserve.
