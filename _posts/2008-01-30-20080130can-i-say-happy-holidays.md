Ok so i&#8217;ve missed a few in between&#8230; Jennifer and I didn&#8217;t get the x-mas cards out, we all got phenomena, lost our luggage, drove all over this great nation meeting and greeting those we hold dear (and throwing in a few new ones) went to a wedding, partied and played with family, found solace in GA and at the end of the day, this is the only picture I could find!!

so&#8230;. HAPPY NEW YEAR FAMILY!!! May 08&#8242; be filled with new experiences, new challenges, and a whole lotta fun!

Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. ~Oprah Winfrey!
