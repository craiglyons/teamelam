Jennifer, noah and I spent the thanksgiving holiday with a couple of friends here in Madison. it was a fantastic day.  Nick is a computer genius who works at Jellyfish and Amy dabbles in photography and graphic design.  She took shots all day of our little feast and  posted some of her pics on flicker. here&#8217;s a link if you want to check them out.

She caught Noah in a light that only someone with an eye for the camera can do. I hope all of you had a great Thanksgiving. We have so much to be thankful for!

blessed be.
