Noah and I are talking at the breakfast table this am. He looks over and says, &#8221; I want to tell you something, but you&#8217;re not going to like it.&#8221; &nbsp;I reply, &#8220;No way! I love your stories!! Tell me! &#8221; He proceeds to say that he&#8217;s marrying his friend at school Megan.&#8221; He&#8217;s right, I hate that. LOL
