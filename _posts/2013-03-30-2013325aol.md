Today was Jennifer&#8217;s first day as the new Design Director for AOL. As he was packing up, he pulled out this note. Something I wrote him when we moved here&#8230;made my heart just spill over to know that he keeps me with him on days like this ðŸ˜‰ It reads:

&#8220;My god but I love you! You&#8217;re going to be great! Your passion is what&#8217;s driven you here; passion for design, for honor, for Imagen and Noah and for me&#8230; That is what&#8217;s guided us here. We are with you. I am always with you. yours jen&#8221; &nbsp;
