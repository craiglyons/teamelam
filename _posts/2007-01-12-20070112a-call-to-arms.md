OK kids, as a gift from our music class we all got a little photo album. It&#8217;s soft so Noah can chew on it and the pics are protected behind this little window. He is at the stage where he&#8217;ll recognize the people he sees in the pics. So, I&#8217;m asking you to send us a picture of you. 5/7, goofy, serious, whatever, just send it!
