My goodness it&#8217;s been too long! Things here at the Elam household have been moving right along! (Those extra naps Noah got into for awhile are now few and far between making mommy&#8217;s &#8220;blog time&#8221; nil) but alas! we just finished celebrating his 1st birthday so I&#8217;m taking advantage of him sleeping off all of that excitement to write! So hang on tight! I&#8217;ve lots to fill you all in on!

FYI! I&#8217;m going to be posting some &#8220;links&#8221; off of this site. The linked word will be highlighted in a different color and underlined. ([like this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/ "like this")) If you click your mouse on that highlighted word, it will take you to a new page (usually more pictures) so make sure you check it out!

It&#8217;s good to be back!
