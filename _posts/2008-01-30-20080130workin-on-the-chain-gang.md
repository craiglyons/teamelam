Yep you read that right! I am a 9-5, up and at-em, working woman, (well maybe not the &#8220;up and at-em&#8221; as I need some quiet time in the AM or the 9-5 as that is a really long day:) but the working part&#8217;s right!

I&#8217;ve been recruited to head up the rights and causes wing of a store here in Madison called &#8220;[The Happy Bambino](http://www.happybambino.com/page.asp?pgid=150001&switch=&shift= "The Happy Bambino")&#8221; They are a local children&#8217;s retail store that dabbles in teaching, classes, music appreciation, ect. They have a lactation consultant on hand, promote healthy natural happy moms, and I&#8217;m simply in love with their mantra of &#8220;combining resource, retail, and community&#8221; Noah and I have been long time advocates of this little community. It&#8217;s been such a rewarding experience already! So many new moms need help and guidance when they first bring their baby&#8217;s home and they get that hope from this store. Its like no other I&#8217;ve ever been to and I feel really lucky to be a part of this team and to see were this new experience will lead&#8230;
