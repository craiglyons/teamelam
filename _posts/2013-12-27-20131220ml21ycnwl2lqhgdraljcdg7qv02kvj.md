All right, I&#8217;m drinking the Caribbean kool-aid. I love how every other person comes from a different country and with that comes with it an inherent edge to a different culture. I feel like the kids get a quick study in diversity and J and I get a true sense of tolerance as their filters don&#8217;t carry any of the prejudices we have. I love that we haven&#8217;t seen another boat, plane or building for days and the sense of freedom in the water is so liberating. I&#8217;m cherishing these moments.
