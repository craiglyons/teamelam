[This was an awesome adventure as we piled in the car and drove up to Baltimore. The aquarium, located in the heart of downtown, hugs the water and boasted magnificent views in every direction as well as activities and eateries EVERYWHERE! As food is my current joie-de-vivre, it was perfect. The kids soaked up the aquarium. The displays were impressive with interactive info about everything we saw as well as huge tanks of fish, sharks, dolphins and a rainforest with monkeys and birds at the top. Definitely recommend the trip!!Â ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157630711738408/)
