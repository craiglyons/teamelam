whew! what a day!! Noah and I rang in the week with quite a few new engagements. We met up with my music together [moms](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/ "moms") at the Lazy Jane Cafe where we celebrated getting there, eating lunch and doing it without getting thrown up on. We lamented our last music together class then danced and sang all through [it.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/427405338/ "it") Noah and I then finish off the day with a play date with Oliver and Alicia where Oliver, following Noah&#8217;s lead, was blowing raspberry&#8217;s like a champ as they were heading out the door! It was fantastic!
  
Speaking of the day, my father-in-law was recently up and brought to my attention how completely different my life is&#8230; I am an suv driving, &#8220;mommy and me&#8221; class taking, stay at home mom&#8230; and I&#8217;m HAPPY! I won&#8217;t ever hide the fact that where Jennifer and i are right now is surprising but I hope that everything in my past- my work at UW, my faith in stem cell research, my ability to enjoy being a mom- will synergise with my future to make me a successful person.

I hope the same for all of you!
