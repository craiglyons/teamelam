yep! i just posted the rest of our pics from [swimming class](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/sets/72157600049893183/ "swimming class"). I&#8217;m not going to lie to you, Noah has not taken to it as i had initially hoped, in fact, i think he would prefer to go back to the pediatrician (as we finished his 6 month check up yesterday) and get more shots than to spend his time in the pool. Do&#8217;nt fret! next week Jennifer (our very own tiny dancer) will be back in the water and i have high hopes that noah will make a full recovery!
