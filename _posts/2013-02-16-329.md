As we contemplated our trek to Disney World, Jennifer and I started packing, reading , researching, on how to best navigate the happiest place on earth with a toddler and baby in tow. To be honest, it can&#8217;t be done &#8211; not it shouldn&#8217;t cause we tried it! but it just can&#8217;t be successfully navigated w/ our current fam. There were small pockets of areas that were designated for Noah but they were a paltry effort for the rest of us. Even Mickey and friends were a little handsy ðŸ™‚ &nbsp;But the thing that turned it around, that completely made the trip &#8211; SHAM-U!! sea world was a wondrous place filled with awesome animals, fascinating displays, we opened and closed the park and made so many memories in the time we were there, I&#8217;m so thankful we went! &nbsp;It is that and that alone that I want preserve from our vacation! The upgraded flight home was lucky and super fun as the kids totally got a kick out of being able to pick from any number of snacks and Imagen took over my primo seat for her owe small little bottom and bunny of course ðŸ™‚
