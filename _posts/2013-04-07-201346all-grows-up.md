Noah had bumps and bruises today that I didn&#8217;t even know about until tonight when I was putting him to bed. It&#8217;s so hard to let him go. To basically put him out there to learn and grow when all I want is to cuddle him up and keep him safe. Such a mom thing! But it wouldn&#8217;t be clich√© if there weren&#8217;t some truth to it and I&#8217;m finding watching him grow and explore that I have to wait for him to share what&#8217;s happening instead of experiencing with him.. Just so hard! Thought I&#8217;d have more time &#8211; like 10 years!! LOL
