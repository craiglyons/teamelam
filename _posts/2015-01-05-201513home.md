Oh my goodness! There&#8217;s nothing like a trip to remind you of the merits of home. My bed, my pillow, this crazy place we&#8217;re building up to make our mark &#8211; never looked so good. My heart is so full watching the kids unload, let go and relax. Thankful for family, for our incredible Christmas and all of the memories we just made, but so very thankful that we have this little piece to come home to&#8230;
