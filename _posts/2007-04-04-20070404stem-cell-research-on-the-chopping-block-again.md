As many of you know, the entire allure of the university of wisconsin was brought about because of their strong role in stem cell research.  Most of that allure is attributed to Dr Jamie Thompson who came to UW following his discovery, isolation -and most notably- replication of a stem cell. He has slowly built up the program to become the best in the nation! The method that he used with these cells was a sought after technique that at that time, no one else could successfully accomplish.  He gladly shared his secretes (for a small fee) and the world of stem cells along with their possibilities, bloomed!

I am orating this fascinating history for you because the patents that he listed this special technique under have been revoked!  This is HUGE for the university as they have been able to become such a force in stem cell research due to the funding (not government affiliated) from this procedure.  If that funding stops, and the bill remains in effect to not allow federal funding for stem cell research, uw&#8217;s ability to continue its&#8217; ground breaking research will slowly but surely die.

I do not feel that the ability for these patents to be approved or disapprooved will hinder the research ongoing at this time.  It has grown throughout the US and other nations as a huge contender for therapies and treatments of disease and illness across the board, I do feel, however, that if these patents remain revoked (he has issued an inquiry into the matter) Wisconsin will not remain in the forefront of this rapidly growing science…
